## Notes
- This code base does not need to be downloaded and ran
- Every commit to this repository automatically deploys it to Azure
- The only purpose for downloading and running this code would be to deploy it somewhere else 

## Assignment description
> ... This group assignment requires you to design and implement a small prototype in order to show case the successful use of web services in order to solve a specific domain.

## Solution Description
- Application Domain
	- Viewing inventories for hypothetical stores in different cities
	- A RESTful service would be helpful here, as any number of clients could access the service and have inventory information at their disposal
- Technologies used
	- [Entity Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/)  for the data models and making the API controllers
	- [Azure Web Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-rest-api) for deploying the RESTful API that is accessed by the front end
