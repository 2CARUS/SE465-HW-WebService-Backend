# SE465-HW-WebService-Backend
## Notes
- #### This API current allows one to make PUT, POST, and DELETE requests, but these will not be saved in the database when the service restarts due to our prototype simulating the lower-privileged "Shopper" user
- This code base does not need to be downloaded and ran
- Every commit to this repository automatically deploys it to Azure
- The only purpose for downloading and running this code would be to deploy it locally or peruse through the code not-in-a-web-browser


## Assignment description
> ... This group assignment requires you to design and implement a small prototype in order to show case the successful use of web services in order to solve a specific domain.

## Solution Description
- Application Domain
	- Viewing inventories for hypothetical stores in different cities
	- A RESTful service would be helpful here, as any number of clients could access the service and have inventory information at their disposal
- Technologies used
	- [Entity Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/)  for the data models and making the API controllers
	- [Azure Web Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-rest-api) for deploying the RESTful API that is accessed by the front end
